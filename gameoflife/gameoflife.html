        <p><u>conway's game of life</u>
        <br>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician
        <br>John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
        <br>initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial
        <br>configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor
        <br>or any other Turing machine.
        <br>
        <br><u>rules</u>
        <br>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
        <br>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
        <br>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
        <br>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
