        <p><u>collatz conjecture</u>
        <br>The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks
        <br>whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer
        <br>into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as
        <br>follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous
        <br>term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences
        <br>always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
